Here we first check if there the array integers are consecutive or not
Then we find the wall heightdifference and gap differnce ie how many walls can be inserted.
If gap is present,we find which stick is having maximum height.
How many gaps need to be filled more is also found out and temp height of the wall.
If gap is not present, the wall height is assumed to be the min of stickheights +1
max returns the max all height which the maximum of available max height and local max height
