Here the palindrome strings are found using recursive approach.
The loop starts from 1st index. and iterates from next index to last using the 2nd loop.
Then we take each subString and check if palindrome using isPalindrome method
In isPalindrome method, 
   if the length of the string is one,it return true ie each letter is palindrome condition is satisfied here.
   else it again checks if the curret string first index and last index is same, ie palindrome check,
   if so it again calls the isPalindrome method and passes the new string excluding the first and last characters, ie
    it checks whether the substring again contains a palindrome string
